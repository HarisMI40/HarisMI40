An integrated platform for managing events and their associated vendor marketplaces.

## The Challenge
Event organizers often rely on manual, disconnected processes (like forms and spreadsheets) to manage vendors and their products, leading to administrative overhead. Vendors, in turn, lack a dedicated digital channel to promote their goods to a captive event audience, while attendees have limited visibility into what the event's marketplace has to offer before they arrive.

## The Solution
Mutu Bazar provides a unified ecosystem where organizers can seamlessly create and promote events. Vendors can easily register (using Google OAuth), create a profile, and list their products under a specific event's marketplace. This gives attendees a digital catalog to browse items, effectively bridging the gap between the physical event and a modern e-commerce experience. The platform is built on a modern, scalable tech stack to ensure high performance and an excellent user interface.

## My Role
As the project initiator and technical lead, I guided a team of students through the development of this application, turning it into a project-based learning experience. I defined the project's vision, scope, and MVP while mentoring the team. My hands-on technical contributions focused on core architectural components: I integrated the database using Prisma, implemented secure user authentication with NextAuth.js, and designed the primary page layouts.
