A learning management system (LMS) I built from the ground up to solve real classroom challenges, enabling self-paced learning for students and centralizing all academic data.

## The Challenge
In my classroom, I faced two primary challenges: differentiated student learning paces and inefficient data management. Faster learners would become disengaged when reviewing material, while others who needed more time would fall behind. Meanwhile, tracking student progress was difficult and time-consuming, with grades and feedback scattered across various spreadsheet files.

## The Solution
EduCodeCamp was designed as a direct solution to these problems. The platform acts as a centralized knowledge hub, allowing students to access all course materials anytime. This empowers them to review difficult topics or advance to the next lesson independently. Furthermore, the interactive coding exercises and a centralized grading system unify the entire academic workflowâ€”from assignments and feedback to progress tracking. This not only creates a more personalized learning experience for students but also significantly streamlines my administrative tasks.

## My Role
As the sole creator, I designed and developed EduCodeCamp from the ground up to directly address the challenges I faced in my own classroom. My role encompassed everything from curriculum strategy and UI/UX design to full-stack development.
