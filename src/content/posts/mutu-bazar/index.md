A modern, easy-to-manage website for a vocational high school using WordPress.

## The Challenge
The school lacked a professional and centralized online presence, making it difficult to effectively communicate with prospective students, parents, and the wider community. Information about admissions, school programs, and news was not easily accessible, and there was no simple way for non-technical staff to post updates.

## The Solution
I developed a comprehensive and user-friendly school website on the WordPress platform. The new site features a clean, responsive design and provides intuitive access to key information. By leveraging the power of the WordPress CMS, I empowered the school's administrative staff to manage and update content—such as news, events, and announcements—independently, ensuring the information remains current without requiring technical assistance.

## My Role
My role was to lead the project from consultation to launch. This included gathering requirements from the school, selecting and customizing a suitable WordPress theme, structuring the site's content architecture, and providing training to the administrative staff on how to effectively use the CMS.
