Hello, I'm Haris Maulana Ikhsan.  My professional journey began with a passion for logic and problem-solving, leading me straight into the world of software development. I spent my early career turning complex ideas into functional code and user-friendly web applications.

My path took an exciting turn when I discovered a deep-seated passion for sharing knowledge, which led me to the classroom. As an educator, I found a unique opportunity to bridge my two worlds. I realized that designing a compelling lesson plan shares a core philosophy with architecting software: both demand a deep empathy for the end-user (the student), clear objectives, and a structured path to a successful outcome.
