title: About Me
---

Hello, I'm Haris Maulana Ikhsan.  I’m a developer passionate about building robust, user-focused web applications and an educator dedicated to making technology accessible and understandable. My favorite work lies at the intersection of engineering and education, creating solutions that are not only well-built but also empower others to learn and grow.

My journey began in software engineering, providing me with a strong foundation in building applications from concept to deployment. This technical background now enriches my teaching, allowing me to bring real-world context and practical skills into the classroom. In turn, my experience as an educator has sharpened my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly—a skill that is invaluable in both development and teaching.

I believe that architecting a software solution and designing a curriculum share a fundamental principle: both require a deep empathy for the end-user. Whether it's a student in a classroom or a user on a website, the goal is to create a clear, effective, and engaging experience. In my spare time, I’m usually reading, exploring new coffee shops, or tinkering with a new side project.
